                Indicates the status of a webhooks subscription. If you disable a subscription, Webhooks v3 continues to monitor events and adds any relevant event notifications to the Webhooks event store. However, these notifications arenâ€™t sent to your listener endpoint. In addition, Webhooks v3 marks these events as `failure` events.
            endpoint:
              type: string
              description: |
                URL of the Webhooks listener endpoint. You set up and maintain listener endpoints on your network to receive and process the event notifications sent by Webhooks v3. See [Configure a webhook listener endpoint](https://techdocs.akamai.com/identity-cloud/docs/configure-a-webhooks-v3-listener-endpoint) for information on configuring your listener endpoint URL.

                Identity Cloud events that trigger webhook event notifications. Possible values are: `entityCreated`, `entityDeleted`, and `entityUpdated`. An `entityCreated` event occurs when a user creates an account. An `entityDeleted` event occurs when a user deletes an account. An  `entityUpdated` event occurs when a user modifies an account. You can also add a filter to your subscription to allow for more fine-grain notifications. See [Create a webhook event filter](https://techdocs.akamai.com/identity-cloud/docs/create-a-webhooks-v3-event-filter) for more information.
