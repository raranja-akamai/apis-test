                Identity Cloud events that trigger webhook event notifications. Possible values are: `entityCreated`, `entityDeleted`, and `entityUpdated`. An `entityCreated` event occurs when a user creates an account. An `entityDeleted` event occurs when a user deletes an account. An `entityUpdated` event occurs when a user modifies an account. You can also add a filter to your subscription to allow for more fine-grain notifications. See [Create a webhook event filter](https://techdocs.akamai.com/identity-cloud/docs/create-a-webhooks-v3-event-filter) for more information.
