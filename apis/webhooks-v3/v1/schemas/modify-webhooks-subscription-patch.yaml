      Indicates the status of a webhooks subscription. If you disable a subscription, Webhooks v3 continues to monitor events and adds any relevant event notifications to the Webhooks event store. However, these notifications aren’t sent to your listener endpoint. In addition, Webhooks v3 marks these events as `failure` events.

      Identity Cloud events that trigger webhook event notifications. Possible values are: `entityCreated`, `entityDeleted`, and `entityUpdated`. An `entityCreated` event occurs when a user creates an account. An `entityDeleted` event occurs when a user deletes an account. An `entityUpdated` event occurs when a user modifies an account. You can also add a filter to your subscription to allow for more fine-grain notifications. See [Create a webhook event filter](https://techdocs.akamai.com/identity-cloud/docs/create-a-webhooks-v3-event-filter) for more information.
