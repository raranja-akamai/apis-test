  Method to use when updating a webhooks subscription. Set the value to `application/merge-patch+json` to modify individual properties and property values in the subscription. For example, if you're only updating the `enabled` property that means that `enabled` is the only property you need in your request body.

  Set this to `application/json-patch+json` to replace the subscription's data with what's in your request. In this case, _all_ the subscription data needs to be in the request body. If you don't include all required members, the operation fails. Any optional data member you leave out gets set to `null`. Note that, regardless of which method you use, the content type in the response is always `application/json`.
