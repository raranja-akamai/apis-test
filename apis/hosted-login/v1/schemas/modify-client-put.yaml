      __Read-only__ OIDC client type. Possible values are `confidential` and `public`. With a confidential client you need to pass the client secret in the authorization request. Public clients donâ€™t have a client secret, meaning there's no secret to pass in the authorization request. Akamai recommends public clients for registering and logging in users.

      URLs you can redirect a user to after they log in. When requesting authorization, your request needs to include one of these URLs. Otherwise the request fails. A redirect URL can be either an `HTTPS` link or a mobile deep link. The only valid `HTTP` link is `localhost`.
