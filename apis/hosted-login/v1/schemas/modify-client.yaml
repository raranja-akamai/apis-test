      OIDC client type. Possible values are `confidential` and `public`. With a confidential client you need to pass the client secret in the authorization request. Public clients don’t have a client secret, meaning there's no secret to pass in the authorization request. Akamai recommends public clients for registering and logging in users.

      URLs you can redirect users to after they log in. When requesting authorization, your request needs to include one of these URLs. If it doesn’t, the request fails. A redirect URL can be either an `HTTPS` link or a mobile deep link. The only valid `HTTP` link is `localhost`.
