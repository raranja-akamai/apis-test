  OpenID Connect (OIDC) scopes accessible from the userinfo endpoint after a user logs in. All Hosted Login authorization requests need to include this parameter and, at a minimum, specify the `openid` scope. This tells the authorization server that you want to authenticate by using OpenID Connect. Your token policy determines the other scopes available to you. If you request a scope the token policy doesn't support, Hosted Login ignores that request. See [Scopes and claims](https://techdocs.akamai.com/identity-cloud/docs/scopes-and-claims) for more information.
