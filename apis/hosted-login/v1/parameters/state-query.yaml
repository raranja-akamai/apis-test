description: |-
  Random string value in an authorization request. This value helps protect against cross-site request forgeries (CSRF). After they log in, Hosted Login redirects users to the URL in the `redirect_uri` parameter. At the same time, Hosted Login adds this value to the redirect URL. That value needs to match the value of the `state` parameter from the original authentication request. If the values don't match that could indicate a cross-site request forgery attack.
