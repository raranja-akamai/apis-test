description: |-
  Random string value in a _close user profile_ request. This helps protect against cross-site request forgeries (CSRF). After users close their profile, Hosted Login redirects them to the URL in the `redirect_uri` parameter. At the same time, Hosted Login adds the `state` value to the redirect URL. That value needs to match the value of the `state` parameter in the original _open user profile_ request. If the values don't match, that could indicate a cross-site request forgery attack.
