  Random string value in a logout request. This helps protect against cross-site request forgeries (CSRF). After a user logs out, Hosted Login redirects the user to the URL in the `redirect_uri` parameter. At the same time, Hosted Login adds this value to the redirect URL. That value needs to match the value of the `state` parameter from the original logout request. If the values don't match that could indicate a cross-site request forgery attack.
