description: |
  Email address of the user requesting authorization. This parameter makes the email address automatically appear in the sign-in screenâ€™s **Email Address** field. That means users only have to enter their password to log in. Keep in mind that Hosted Login can't determine the user's email address. Instead, you'll need to use an alternate approach to identify, and to store, that email address.
