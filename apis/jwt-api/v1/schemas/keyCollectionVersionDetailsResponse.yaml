  description:
    type: string
    description: |
      A description for the key collection version.
    minLength: 1
  algorithm:
    type: string
    description: |
      The encryption algorithm of the public keys in the `primaryKey` and `secondaryKey` members, either `RSA` or `ECDSA_P_256`.
    enum:
    - RSA
    - ECDSA_P_256
    minLength: 1
  algorithmDetails:
    type: string
    description: |
      Details about the encryption algorithm used to generate the public  key in the `primaryKey` member. For `RSA`, it specifies the length of an RSA   key. For `ECDSA_P_256`, it specifies the parameter of the P-256 elliptic curve, only `secp256k1` is available at this time. See [Keys and JWT signing algorithms](ref:keys-and-jwt-signing-algorithms).
    minLength: 1
  collectionId:
    type: integer
    description: |
      The identifier of the key collection.
    minimum: 1
  primaryKey:
    type: string
    description: |
      The primary RSA or ECDSA public key. The version uses it to validate JWT signatures. This key is in PEM format, which presents base64-encoded data between the begin header and the end footer. See [Keys and JWT signing algorithms](ref:keys-and-jwt-signing-algorithms).

  secondaryKey:
    type: string
    description: |
      The backup RSA or ECDSA public key. The version uses it to validate JWT signatures in case the `primaryKey` fails. This key is in PEM format, which presents base64-encoded data between the begin header and the end footer. See [Key rotation](ref:rotate-public-keys) and [Keys and JWT signing algorithms](ref:keys-and-jwt-signing-algorithms).
