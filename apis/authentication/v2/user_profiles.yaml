      - User profiles
      description: |
        Updates a user profile. This operation only updates the user profile attributes in the request. User profile attributes not in the request are left as they are.

        To update a profile you can use any of the fields on the form. For example, if your form includes the `firstName` field you can update that field by including a line like this in your request: `"firstName": "Matthew"`.

        If you need to set the value of a boolean field to `false`, don't include that field in your operation, and don't set the value to `false`. In other words, the following syntax _doesn't_ set the boolean field `newsletterSubscriber` to `false`: `newsletterSubscriber=false`.

        Instead, the preceding code actually sets `newsletterSubscriber` to `true`. That's due to the way that the Authentication API handles boolean values. If a boolean attribute is in your request, its value is automatically set to `true` regardless of the value in the request. If the attribute isn't in the request, the value is set to `false`.

        You don't need any authorization to call this operation.
