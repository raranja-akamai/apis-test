  merge_token:
    type: string
    description: |
      If a previous operation fails with an error code of `380 email_address_in_use`, you can use this to merge the social account from that operation with an existing account. For example, suppose a user logs on by using Facebook, and Facebook returns `karim.nafir@example.com`, an email address in use by an existing Identity Cloud account. In that case, set `merge_token` to add Facebook to the existing account as a social login identity provider. The value is the token from the previous operation. See [Additional Authentication API examples](https://techdocs.akamai.com/identity-cloud/docs/additional-authentication-api-examples) for sample code.
