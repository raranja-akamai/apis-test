  client_id:
    type: string
    description: |
      Unique identifier of the API client authenticating the operation. This client needs to have the `login_client` feature, which gives it permission to call login and registration operations.

  flow:
    type: string

      Name of the API client's flow.
    minLength: 1
  flow_version:
    type: string
    description: |
      Version number of the flow in the `flow` member. Note that you can't set the value of this member to `HEAD`, a shorthand way to refer to the most recent version of the flow. Instead, you need to specify a valid version number.

  locale:
    type: string
    description: |
      RFC 5646 language code for the profile management process. The locale determines the language for any messages the user sees and for any emails sent to that user. See [Supported languages and locales](https://techdocs.akamai.com/identity-cloud/docs/hosted-login-supported-languages-and-locales-1) for more information.

  merge_token:
    type: string
    description: |
      If a previous operation fails with an error code of `380 email_address_in_use`, you can use this to merge the social account from that operation with an existing account. For example, suppose a user logs on by using Facebook, and Facebook returns `karim.nafir@example.com`, an email address used by an existing Identity Cloud account. In that case, set `merge_token` to add Facebook to the existing account as a social login identity provider. The value is the token from the previous operation. See [Additional Authentication API examples](https://techdocs.akamai.com/identity-cloud/docs/additional-authentication-api-examples) for sample code.

  redirect_uri:
    type: string
    description: |
      Typically the redirect URL from the initial authorization request. If using the JavaScript SDK, this value needs to match the value of the SDK's `redirectUri` setting.
