  network:
    type: string
    description: |
      The network, either `STAGING`, `PRODUCTION`, or `prod` as shorthand, on which a load balancing configuration for Application Load Balancer has been activated. Values are case-insensitive in requests.

  originId:
    type: string
    description: |
      The conditional origin's unique identifier.
  status:
    type: string
    description: |
      The activation status for the load balancing version. Values include the following: `inactive` where the load balancing version has not been activated. No active property versions reference this policy. A value of `active` means the load balancing version is currently active (published) and its associated property version is also active. A `deactivated` value means the load balancing version was previously activated but it has been superseded by a more recent activation of another load balancing version. A `pending` value means the load balancing version is proceeding through the activation workflow. Otherwise the value is `failed` if a problem occurs.
    enum:
    - inactive
    - active
    - deactivated
    - pending
    - failed
