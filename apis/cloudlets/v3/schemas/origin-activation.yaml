  status:
    type: string
    description: |
      The activation status for the policy or property. Values include the following: `inactive` where the policy version has not been activated. No active property versions reference this policy. An `active` value means the policy version is currently active (published) and its associated property version is also active. A `deactivated` value means the policy version was previously activated but it has been superseded by a more recent activation of another policy version. A `pending` value means the policy version is proceeding through the activation workflow. Otherwise the value is `failed` if a problem occurs.
    enum:
    - inactive
    - active
    - deactivated
    - pending
