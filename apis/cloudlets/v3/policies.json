When cloning a non-shared policy to a shared policy, a group ID (`groupId`) is required. Policies created using API v2 don't require a `groupId`, so the non-shared policy that you're cloning might not have this data member. If the policy you're cloning doesn’t have a `groupId`, assign one while performing this operation. To check if the non-shared policy has a `groupId`, see [List policies](https://techdocs.akamai.com/cloudlets/v2/reference/get-policies).\n",
