        Launches an [asynchronous](ref:asynchronous-processes) request to fetch logs for an edge server IP address using the `grep` command.  To verify if an IP belongs to an edge server, run the [Verify an IP](ref:post-verify-edge-ip) operation first. If you known the exact values to filter the logs by and you want to get the data directly, run the synchronous [Get specific logs](ref:get-grep) operation.

        Using the `grep` command, returns logs that match the query parameters. This operation gets the data  directly. If you don't have detailed information about the logs or you want to avoid latency, run the [Launch a GREP request](ref:post-grep) operation. If you provide request parameters  for which Edge Diagnostics doesn't find logs, you get the validation error.
