  Provides details about the S3-compatible destination in a stream. When validating this destination, DataStream uses the provided `accessKey` and `secretAccessKey` values and saves an `Akamai_access_verification_[TimeStamp].txt` format file in your S3-compatible folder. You can only see this file if the validation process is successful, and you have access to the S3-compatible bucket and folder that you're trying to send logs to. Before configuring your stream to send logs to this destination, make sure you create a S3-compatible storage bucket, and store the access key together with the secret access key.
