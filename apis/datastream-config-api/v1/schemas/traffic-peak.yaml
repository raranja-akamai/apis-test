  Details the TrafficPeak endpoint you can use as a destination for a stream, including basic authentication. Choosing TrafficPeak for delivery streams requires logging the **Request time** (ID: `1100`) data set field. For Edge DNS and GTM streams, it requires the **Epoch timestamp** (ID: `4002` and `5002` respectively) field. If you choose this destination, the stream pushes a sample `{"access_validation":true}` POST request to the endpoint to validate write access. You can see the data only if the destination validates, and you can access the destination storage.
