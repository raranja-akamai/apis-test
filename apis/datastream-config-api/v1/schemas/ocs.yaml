  Provides details about the Oracle Cloud destination in a stream. When validating this destination, DataStream uses the provided `accessKey` and `secretAccessKey` values and tries to save an `Akamai_access_verification_[TimeStamp].txt` file in your Oracle Cloud folder. You can only see this file if the validation succeeded, and if you have access to the Oracle Cloud bucket and folder that you're trying to send logs to.
