      format:
        type: string
        description: |
          The format in which you want to receive log files. You can choose the `STRUCTURED` or `JSON` format for your stream. When the delimiter is present in the request, you need to choose the `STRUCTURED` format.

        - JSON
      fieldDelimiter:
        type: string
        description: |
          A delimiter that separates data set fields in the log lines, either `SPACE` or `TAB`. Set this only for the `STRUCTURED` log file `format`.

  collectMidgress:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Set to `true` for every edit operation to collect midgress traffic data within the Akamai platform, such as between two edge servers. Enable logging midgress data to get numeric values in the second place of the log line that indicate if the request was processed within the Akamai platform. When you [Get a stream](ref:get-stream) that logs midgress traffic, the response returns `collectMidgress` as `true` and lists the `isMidgress` data set field with other fields. See [Midgress traffic](doc:data-set-parameters#midgress-traffic) for details. If this feature is not enabled on your account, contact the Akamai support team.
