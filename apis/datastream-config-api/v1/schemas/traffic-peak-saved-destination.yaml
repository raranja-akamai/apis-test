description: |-
  Details the TrafficPeak endpoint you can use as a destination for a stream, including basic authentication. If you choose this destination, the stream pushes a sample `{"access_validation":true}` POST request to the endpoint to validate write access. You can see the data only if the destination validates, and you can access the destination storage.
