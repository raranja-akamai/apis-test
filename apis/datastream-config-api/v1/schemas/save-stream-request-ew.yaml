    properties:
      format:
        type: string
        description: |
          The format in which you want to receive log files. Currently available formats are `STRUCTURED` or `JSON`. When the delimiter is present in the request, you need to choose the `STRUCTURED` format. For details, see [Log format](ref:log-format).

        - JSON
      fieldDelimiter:
        type: string
        description: |
          A delimiter that separates data set fields in the log lines, either `SPACE` or `TAB`. Set this only for the `STRUCTURED` log file `format`.
        enum:
        - SPACE
        - TAB
      frequency:
        type: object
        description: |
          The frequency to collect logs from each uploader and send them to a destination.

        properties:
          intervalInSeconds:
            type: integer
            description: |
              The interval in seconds (`30` or `60`) after which the system bundles log lines into a file and sends it to a destination.

          numberOfRecords:
            type: integer
            description: |
              The maximum number of records in a single log file. When there are more records than the `numberOfRecords`, DataStream chunks the log file into different parts.
            minimum: 1
            maximum: 32000
          sizeInMb:
            type: integer
            description: |
              The maximum log file size in megabytes. When the log file size is larger than `sizeInMb`, DataStream chunks it into separate files.
            maximum: 4
      uploadFilePrefix:
        type: string
        description: |
          The log filename prefix that you want to send to an object-based destination, up to 200 characters. If unspecified, it defaults to `ak`. This data supports [Dynamic time variables](ref:custom-log-field#dynamic-time-variables), but doesn't support the dot (`.`) character.
