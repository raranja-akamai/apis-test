  Details the custom HTTPS endpoint you can use as a destination for a stream. This includes basic or no authentication, and whether the stream sends uncompressed or gzip-compressed log files. If you choose this destination, the stream pushes a sample POST request to the endpoint to validate write access. For `STRUCTURED` logs, the data is sent as `0,access_validation`, and for `JSON` it's `{"access_validation":true}`. You can see the data only if the destination validates, and you can access the destination storage.

properties:
  authenticationType:
    type: string
    description: |
      Either `NONE` for no authentication, or `BASIC`. For basic authentication, provide the username and password you set in your custom HTTPS endpoint.
    enum:
    - NONE
    - BASIC
  caCert:
    type: string
    description: |
      The certification authority (CA) certificate that verifies the origin server's certificate. If the certificate is not signed by a well-known certification authority, enter the CA certificate in the PEM format for verification. If you set this data, the `mTlsEnabled` property replaces it in the response as `true`.
  clientCert:
    type: string
    description: |
      The PEM-formatted digital certificate to authenticate requests to your destination. To use mutual authentication, provide both the client certificate and the client key. Once you provide this certificate, the response indicates this with a `mTlsEnabled` of `true`.
  clientKey:
    type: string
    description: |
      The private key in the non-encrypted PKCS8 format that authenticates with the back-end server. If you want to use mutual authentication, you need to provide both the client certificate and the client key.
  compressLogs:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enables gzip compression for a log file sent to a destination. The value is `false` by default.
    default: false
  contentType:
    type: string
    description: |
      The type of the resource passed in the request's custom header. For details, see the additional options discussed in [Stream logs to a HTTPS endpoint](doc:stream-custom-https#additional-options).
  customHeaderName:
    type: string
    description: |
      A human-readable name for the request's custom header, containing only alphanumeric, dash, and underscore characters. For details, see the additional options discussed in [Stream logs to a HTTPS endpoint](doc:stream-custom-https#additional-options).
  customHeaderValue:
    type: string
    description: |
      The custom header's contents passed with the request that contains information about the client connection. For details, see the additional options discussed in [Stream logs to a HTTPS endpoint](doc:stream-custom-https#additional-options).
  destinationType:
    type: string
    description: |
      The destination type's name. Set it to `HTTPS` for this destination type.
    enum:
    - HTTPS
  displayName:

      The destination's name.
  endpoint:
    type: string
    description: |
      Enter the secure URL where you want to send and store your logs. You can use hostnames served over the Akamai network as endpoint URLs. See [Stream logs to a custom HTTPS endpoint](doc:stream-custom-https#akamaized-hostname-as-endpoint).
  password:
    type: string
    description: |
      Enter the password you set in your custom HTTPS endpoint for authentication.
  tlsHostname:
    type: string
    description: |
      The hostname that verifies the server's certificate and matches the Subject Alternative Names (SANs) in the certificate. If not provided, DataStream fetches the hostname from the endpoint URL.
