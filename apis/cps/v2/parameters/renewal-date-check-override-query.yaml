description: |-
  CPS automatically starts a change to renew certificates in time before they expire. This automatic change starts when the certificate's expiration is within a renewal window. CPS prevents other changes from starting during this renewal window. Setting `renewal-date-check-override=true` allows changes during the renewal window, potentially running the risk of an expired certificate on the network.
