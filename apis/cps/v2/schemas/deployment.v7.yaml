        description: |
          Server Name Indication (SNI) is an extension of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) networking protocol. It allows a server to present many certificates on the same IP address. All modern web browsers support the SNI extension. If you have the same SAN on two or more certificates with the SNI-only option set, Akamai may serve traffic using any certificate which matches the requested SNI hostname. You should avoid any certificates with overlapping SAN names when using SNI-only.
