          The change request's state. Possible values are: `new`, `running`, `awaiting-input`, `error`, `suspended`, `cancelled`, and `completed`. A value of `new` means the certificate is processed but the renewal process didn't start. An `awaiting-input` value means the process is waiting on a user input, for example the approval or denial of a change management item. A `suspended` value indicates the process didn't complete. A value of `cancelled` means that the process has been cancelled permanently.
