  An enrollment displays all the information about the process that your certificate goes through from the time you request it, through renewal, and as you obtain subsequent versions. CPS is a certificate life cycle management tool. Once you obtain a certificate, you use it until it expires, in most cases a year from the date the CA issued the certificate. CPS automatically starts the renewal process 90 days before the old certificate expires. It then automatically deploys the renewed certificate when it receives it from the CA.

      Setting this to `true` for an enrollment stops CPS from deploying the certificate to the network until you acknowledge you're ready to deploy the certificate. You can test the certificate outside of CPS, on the Edge Staging Network (ESN), to make sure it works in your environment, and then deploy the certificate. The ESN is a small network of Akamai edge servers built to simulate Akamai's production network to test most of your site or application functionality with current production version configuration options and functions. For more information on the ESN, see the [Edge Staging Network User Guide](https://control.akamai.com/dl/customers/other/EDGESERV/ESN-User-Guide.pdf). You can also contact your account representative with questions or issues with your service on the ESN.

Specify OCSP Stapling if you want to improve performance by allowing your site's visitors to query the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) server at regular intervals to obtain a signed time-stamped OCSP response. This response needs to be signed by the CA, not the server, therefore ensuring security. Disable OSCP Stapling if you want your site's visitors to contact the CA directly for an OSCP response. You can use OCSP to obtain a certificate's revocation status. You should enable this feature. Use `on` to enable OSCP Stapling, `off` to disable it, or `not-set` to ignore it.

      CPS supports several types of validation: `dv`, `ev`, `ov`, or `third-party`. Domain Validation (`dv`) offers the lowest level of validation. The CA validates that you have control of the domain. CPS supports DV certificates issued by Let's Encrypt, a free, automated, and open CA, run for public benefit. Organization Validation (`ov`) offers the next level of validation. The CA validates that you have control of the domain. Extended Validation (`ev`) offers the highest level of validation, in which you need to have signed letters and notaries sent to the CA before signing. You can also specify `third-party` if you want to use a signed certificate you obtain from a CA that CPS doesn't directly support.
