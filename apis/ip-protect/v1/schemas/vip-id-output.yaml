    sourceIpProtocol:
      type: string
      description: |
        Specifies the source IP for network packets received at a customer's back-end server or subnet. By default, packets are set to `NA`, identifying Akamai as the source IP. Other source IP options are `NAT46`, `CIP`, `PROXY_PROTOCOL_V1`, `PROXY_PROTOCOL_V2`, and `OPTION_28`. `NAT46` is only available if the virtual IP address has an IPv4 address and the back-end IP has an IPv6 address. The remaining options require the virtual IP address to be running on a TCP network.
      enum:
      - CIP
      - PROXY_PROTOCOL_V1
      - PROXY_PROTOCOL_V2
      - OPTION_28
      - NAT46
      - NA
