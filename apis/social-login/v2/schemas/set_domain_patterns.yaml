  Updates the domains allowlist for an application. This operation replaces all the domains currently on the list with the domains in the request. You can use wildcards when adding a domain. For example, `*.akamai.com` adds any subdomains of `akamai.com` to the allowlist. Run the [Add domains to the domains allowlist](ref:post-add-domain-patterns) operation to append additional domains to the allowlist without affecting any domains currently on the list.
