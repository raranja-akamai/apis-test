      Specifies the device types that can use social login. Possible values are: `web`, `iphone`, and `android`. A `web` value makes social login available to regular web traffic. An `iphone` value makes social login available to web traffic originating from an iPhone. An `android` value means social login is available to web traffic originating from an Android device. To make the provider available to more than one device type, make additional requests with different values. For example, make a request with the value set to `web`, then a second request set to `iphone`.
